'''This cost function is linearly combined with the length penalization, gamma, and L_t is the length of the sentence

The softmax cross_entropy cost function will be substituted with the maximum mutual information

these pairs are chosne betwen p(S,T)/p(S)p(T)

Normally a softmax is calculated by the multiplication of series of wrong numbers -- this is denoted by the cross_entropy cost.

the | in p(a|b) means A given b -- conditional probability

P(a|b) = P(a ^ b) / P(b)

if p(b) is undefined, then the p(a|b) is undefined

lamda is a hyperparameter that controls how much to penalize generic responses
